# vibe-seeder

*vibe-seeder* is an experimental project exploring LLM-based role-playing characters with self-driven mood & randomness control.

---

## Why this project?

While playing with [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), I realized that seed value controls much more than just randomness.

Seed directly impacts the *vibe* of a character's output.

So this project is my way to go deep into:
- Seed as personality driver
- Seed as mood evolution tool
- Seed as story mechanic

---

## Core Idea

> Characters pick their own vibe → generate their own seed → live with it.

---

## Main Goals of vibe-seeder

1. Characters describe their current mood/vibe
2. Characters generate their own seed (in dialogue)
3. That seed is actually used as LLM sampling seed (affecting next response)
4. Logs & tracks mood & seed history over time

---

## Future Ideas
- Mood drift engine (seed evolution)
- Memory logs
- Seed-to-mood mapping
- Multi-character interactions
- Seed-based story arcs

---

## Run Locally (coming soon)
